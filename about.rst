     <p>
       <i class="dropcap">I</i> am a full-stack software developer with a background in design and communications, motivated by clean, effective,
       and performant code that addresses real-world business concerns.
     </p>
     <p>
       Leveraging rapid skill acquisition and practical experience, I am adept in the core stages of software development:
       information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery, and maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
       Having experience in the upkeep and refactoring of legacy code for large-scale B2B software applications,
       and contributing executable code to new business development (mobile and desktop), I am a flexible developer
       who is an asset no matter the language, challenge, or position.
